      <header>About Me</header>
      <p>I was born and raised in Kyoto, Japan. Moved to the US in 2016, and currently working at Toyo Automotive Parts as a part of the quality team. I am also a part time Web Development Bootcamp student at Nashville Software School. It started with my out - of - nowhere thoughts of building a web application. This is the most interesting thing I have ever learned in my life and I just cannot get enough of it. Software development is an endless journey of learning, problem solving, and being creative. I love it so much.</p>
